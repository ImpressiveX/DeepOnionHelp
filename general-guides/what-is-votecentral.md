# What is VoteCentral?

VoteCentral is a web application developed my the DeepOnion team. It allows the community to vote on important decisions about DeepOnionâ€™s direction. Each person who meets the criteria to participate will have the opportunity to vote and help shape the path of the DeepOnion currency.

VoteCentral is an important feature because it democratizes DeepOnion, ensuring that no one person, or small group of people, have too much control over the project. All decisions will be community driven.
